11,mRNA levels of resistin were earlier found to be down-regulated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in rodent adipocytes (13).,2
12,"The 3D structures of the trimeric and hexameric forms of wild-type hRes, built using MODELER by using mouse resistin as a template (14)  (Fig S1A), generated rmsd values of 0.213 and 0.533 Å for trimer and hexamer, respectively",2

15,Light-scattering assay to monitor aggregation was carried out by measuring absorbance (320 nm) of thermally denatured citrate synthase (CS) (15) and Nde1 in the absence or presence of rhRes/F49YrhRes (Fig 1),2
16,"We then examined whether rhRes can protect CS and Nde1 from thermal aggregation, a property common to most chaperones (16)",contradicting
17,The human leukemic monocyte lymphoma cell line U937 was used for these studies as they were shown to express resistin in high abundance (18),2

21,"Surface hydrophobicity is critical for chaperones as these are considered instrumental in interactions with unfolded or misfolded proteins (19), and replacement of any of these hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic residues should result in significant structural alterations, which would then disrupt interaction with misfolded proteins, as reported for some heat-shock proteins (20)",2

23,Increased molecular rearrangements accompanied by higher affinity for unfolded proteins is considered a paradigm of chaperone action (21),contradicting
24,"Similar examples of proteins that work like a chaperone under cellular stress conditions in the absence of ATP hydrolysis have been reported; these include Clusterin (22), which is a secretory mammalian chaperone, and Spy (23), an E",2
25,Cellular responses to stress can progress to apoptosis or adaptive responses (24),contradicting
26,"Stress induces different responses depending upon its nature, duration, and severity (25)",2
27,"Celluar stress is often manifested by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, leading to UPR in eukaryotes (26)",2
28,This is in agreement with literature reports that chaperones are restricted to the ER upon stress to assist in the refolding of misfolded proteins (27).,2
29,hRes was suggested as a biomarker for disease staging and treatment end-point determination in tuberculosis (29),2
30,"Some human disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis, and neuronal damage by ischemia, are related to ER stress, which leads to intraluminal accumulation of unfolded proteins (30)",2
31,"The unfolded protein responses are central to inflammatory disorders, thereby establishing a fine link between protein folding and inflammation (31).",2
