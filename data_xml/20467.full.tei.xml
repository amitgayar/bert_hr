<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_cJu5dV6"><p xml:id="_DS8VGqY">Resistin, a cysteine-rich adipocytokine, proposed as a link between obesity and diabetes in mice, was shown as a proinflammatory molecule in humans. We earlier reported that human resistin (hRes), a trimer, was resistant to heat and urea denaturation, existed in an oligomeric polydispersed state, and showed a concentrationdependent conformational change. These properties and an intimate correlation of hRes expression with cellular stress prompted us to investigate hRes as a possible chaperone. Here, we show that recombinant human resistin was able to protect the heat-labile enzymes citrate synthase and Nde1 from thermal aggregation and inactivation and was able to refold and restore their enzymatic activities after heat/guanidinium chloride denaturation. Furthermore, recombinant human resistin could bind misfolded proteins only. Molecular dynamics-based association-dissociation kinetics of hRes subunits pointed to resistin being a molecular chaperone. Bis-ANS, which blocks surface hydrophobicity, abrogated the chaperone activity of hRes, establishing the importance of surface hydrophobicity for chaperone activity. Replacement of Phe49 with Tyr (F49YhRes), a critical residue within the hydrophobic patch of hRes, although it could prevent thermal aggregation of citrate synthase and Nde1, was unable to refold and restore their activities. Treatment of U937 cells with tunicamycin/thapsigargin resulted in reduced hRes secretion and concomitant localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Escherichia coli transformants expressing hRes could be rescued from thermal stress, pointing to hRes's chaperone-like function in vivo. HeLa cells transfected with hRes showed protection from thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, hRes, an inflammatory protein, additionally exhibited chaperone-like properties, suggesting a possible link between inflammation and cellular stress.</p><p xml:id="_zEdNcj5">protein folding | chaperokine R esistin, a small cysteine-rich secreted protein, is predominantly produced in human macrophages (1, 2). Resistin levels in human serum could neither be associated with obesity nor linked with insulin resistance (3), pointing to possible other role(s) for this hormone. We, and later others, showed that human resistin (hRes) is a proinflammatory molecule that stimulates the synthesis and secretion of TNF-α and IL-12 from macrophages through an NF-κB-activated pathway (4, 5). hRes mRNA levels are strongly induced by TNF-α and IL-6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (6, 7). Although human and mouse resistin share 64.4 and 59% sequence homology at mRNA and amino acids levels, respectively, they differ considerably in terms of their structural organization (8). We earlier reported, based on extensive biophysical analyses, that recombinant human resistin (rhRes) is a highly stable molecule that exists in oligomeric states as a function of concentration with no major loss in helicity and displays slightly altered tertiary structure with an increase in temperature (9, 10). The variable oligomeric states and poly-dispersity of hRes are features often attributed to chaperones (11, 12). mRNA levels of resistin were earlier found to be down-regulated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in rodent adipocytes (13).</p><p xml:id="_VQTXYQy">Cellular stress in any form, including infection, can alter the cellular metabolism, leading to improperly folded, defective, and aggregated proteins within the ER. This induces ER stress, which then triggers unfolded protein response (UPR). Under such conditions, molecular chaperones play a crucial role in assisting proper folding of proteins. The observations that hRes (i) is a small molecule of 8-12 kDa; (ii) exists in different forms, including high molecular mass oligomers; (iii) has a secondary structure that is refractile to increasing temperature; (iv) is highly resistant to chemical denaturation; and (v) has expression levels that correlate with stress conditions led us to suggest that hRes could act as a molecular chaperone. In this study we show that rhRes binds to nonnative proteins in vitro and protects them from thermal and chemical denaturation while preserving their enzymatic activity. Escherichia coli cells, overexpressing hRes, could survive when exposed to higher temperatures. In mammalian cells, an elevated level of hRes was observed upon induction of ER stress by tunicamycin (tn) and thapsigargin (tp). hRes, an otherwise secreted protein, was retained in the cell and localized in the ER upon ER stress. HeLa cells transfected with hRes showed protection from tp-induced apoptosis. These observations prompted us to conclude that hRes, apart from being a proinflammatory molecule, possibly functions as a chaperone under stress conditions.</p></div>

Four amino acids within the mature polypeptide, namely Leu42, Pro46, and Phe49, and Trp80, were found to be surface-exposed in the homology model. To validate these predictions, one of these amino acids, namely Phe at position 49, was mutated to Tyr by site-directed mutagenesis <ref type="figure" coords="2,146.21,100.21,39.65,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1A)</ref>, and the impact of this mutation (F49Y) on the surface hydrophobicity was determined using the hydrophobe-selective dye 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS). Although the wild-type rhRes showed ANS binding, as evident from spectroscopic measurement, the mutant F49YrhRes showed negligible binding <ref type="figure" coords="2,196.06,147.72,38.38,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1B)</ref>.

Our earlier studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,42.86,204.64,10.09,8.31" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,55.79,204.64,12.33,8.31" target="#b9">10)</ref> showed that the molecular mass of hRes varied between 11.3 and 600 kDa in solution. These oligomeric structural features of hRes, reminiscent of chaperone-like proteins, prompted us to carry out molecular simulation studies of hRes and F49YhRes structures in trimer and hexamer forms at 298 and 333 K using GROMACS, which were analyzed using trajectory files obtained during 20-ns simulations. The rmsd plots of trimer of hRes and F49YhRes showed the difference in association and dissociation. hRes trimer started converging after 10 ns of simulations. The rmsd convergence of protein at 298 K reached 0.5 and 0.6 nm for 333 K as observed at the end of simulations <ref type="figure" coords="2,270.08,299.59,17.81,8.31;2,42.86,309.12,7.45,8.31">(Fig.  S3</ref>). During the 20-ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, the hRes trimer C-terminal β-sandwich head domain rearranges from trimer to dimer-monomer arrangement, thus exposing internal cavity to solvent <ref type="figure" coords="2,130.96,337.64,43.33,8.31">(Fig. S3, iv)</ref>. F49YhRes trimer converged after 15 ns of the simulations for both 298 K and 333 K <ref type="figure" coords="2,252.90,347.10,31.29,8.31">(Fig. S4)</ref>. At the end of the simulations, the protein at 298 K reached the convergence near 0.5 nm, and at 333 K it converged near 0.6 nm. Compared with rhRes, F49YhRes trimer undergoes less rearrangement and prefers to retain the trimer conformation. However, no dissociation of hexamer hRes was observed during simulations either at 298 K or at 350 K <ref type="figure" coords="2,204.04,404.14,29.57,8.31" target="#fig_3">(Fig. S5</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_juqBEa7">rhRes and F49YrhRes Can Protect Citrate Synthase and Restriction Enzyme Nde1 from Thermal Aggregation. To experimentally demonstrate chaperone-like activity of rhRes, the ability of this adipocytokine to protect heterologous proteins from thermal denaturation was assessed. Light-scattering assay to monitor aggregation was carried out by measuring absorbance (320 nm) of thermally denatured citrate synthase (CS) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.48,480.56,15.69,8.31" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and Nde1 in the absence or presence of rhRes/F49YrhRes <ref type="figure" coords="2,160.83,490.03,23.67,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>). These two enzymes were selected based on their thermal sensitivity and availability of convenient assays to monitor activity. The thermal stability of all of the proteins in the experiment, namely rhRes, F49YrhRes, CS, and Nde1, was also checked individually. As expected for molecular chaperones, rhRes and the mutant rF49YrhRes were highly stable at 45°C for more than 45 min, showing negligible aggregation, where as CS and Nde1 aggregated considerably with time ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,324.96,100.20,21.72,8.31" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> A and B, respectively). We then examined whether rhRes can protect CS and Nde1 from thermal aggregation, a property common to most chaperones <ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.68,119.20,14.35,8.31" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Nde1 in the presence of 0.15 μM rhRes was highly stable <ref type="figure" coords="2,448.44,128.66,31.08,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B</ref>) compared with incubation with 0.15 μM lysozyme (negative control). Likewise, rhRes could protect CS against thermal aggregation, and this protection was similar to that seen using a known chaperone, GroEL <ref type="figure" coords="2,331.14,166.70,32.41,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. The ability to protect Nde1 and CS from thermal denaturation remained unaltered for the mutant F49YrhRes ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,304.88,185.42,60.31,8.72" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 B and C)</ref>, consistent with its thermal stability <ref type="figure" coords="2,509.44,185.70,33.01,8.31" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. These results clearly demonstrate that both rhRes and F49YrhRes can protect proteins from thermal denaturation/aggregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_X7pBvSD">Nde1 and CS Protected from Denaturation by rhRes Were Enzymatically</head><p xml:id="_DwWtNUV">Active. Having shown that rhRes can protect Nde1 and CS from thermal denaturation, we investigated if the protected proteins are also functionally active. Enzyme activity of Nde1, after heat denaturation at 60°C for 20 min, was measured using pUC18. Linearized pUC18 was visualized by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. Upon heat denaturation, Nde1 could not cleave pUC18 ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,517.13,281.12,25.13,8.31" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>, lane 3); however, when Nde1 was heat-denatured in the presence of rhRes, much of its DNA cleavage activity was retained as evident from a single linearized pUC18 band after Nde1 digestion ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,518.07,309.58,24.22,8.31" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>, lane 4). In the presence of either F49YrhRes or control protein BSA, Nde1 activity was lost ( <ref type="figure" coords="2,407.40,328.62,24.29,8.31" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). It therefore appeared that rhRes not only can prevent physical aggregation of Nde1 upon heating, but also can preserve the functional activity of the protein. The mutant F49YrhRes, although it protected the protein from aggregation, could not prevent loss of enzyme activity upon heat treatment, pointing to the functional importance of the F49 residue of hRes.</p><p xml:id="_Zx3zEYD">The ability of rhRes and F49YrhRes to refold and restore enzyme activity of unfolded protein after denaturation was then assessed. Denaturation with 6 M guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) resulted in complete loss of CS enzyme activity <ref type="figure" coords="2,483.98,423.58,28.34,8.31" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B</ref>). Denatured CS was then diluted in the appropriate buffer to refold in the presence of GroEL (positive control) (17), rhRes, or F49YrhRes. Refolding of CS was assessed in terms of the recovery of its enzyme activity, monitored by the disappearance of acetyl-CoA at 233 nm in a reaction mix containing oxaloacetic acid, acetyl-CoA, and nitrobenzoic acid. CS enzyme activity was plotted as the percentage of the native activity. It could be seen <ref type="figure" coords="2,301.38,499.55,30.29,8.31" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B</ref>) that, although GdnHCl-denatured CS showed almost complete loss of enzyme activity, when refolded in the presence of either rhRes or GroEL, about 75-80% of the activity was regained. CS refolded in the presence of F49YrhRes was found to be functionally inactive <ref type="figure" coords="3,142.58,417.18,33.10,8.31" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. These results reconfirmed the earlier observation that, although rhRes can restore the activity of the refolded denatured protein, the F49YrhRes mutant cannot do so.</p><p xml:id="_XkxvWKq">Exposed-Surface Hydrophobicity Is Important for Chaperone Activity.</p><p xml:id="_GTYag5K">We next evaluated the importance of total surface hydrophobicity, rather than a single hydrophobic amino acid change, on chaperone activity. The dimeric analog of ANS, 4,4′-bis-1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (bis-ANS), was photo-incorporated onto the rhRes molecule by UV irradiation and used in our assays. If the hydrophobic patches on the surface of rhRes were important for chaperone-like activity, one would expect that binding of bis-ANS to rhRes (bis-ANS-rhRes) should not protect proteins from functional inactivation at high temperature. Nde1 (10 units) was incubated at 60°C for 20 min in the absence or presence of either rhRes or bis-ANS-rhRes. The heat-denatured Nde1 was then used to digest pUC18.

To explore if rhRes, like chaperones, differentiates between native and nonnative proteins, we incubated rhRes with native or denatured CS in equimolar concentration, followed by immunoprecipitation with antihRes antibodies.

The levels of hRes were monitored by Western blot with anti-hRes antibody after 24 h of treatment under increasing concentrations of tn/tp (2-15 μg/mL).

Taken together, these results show that ER stress induced resistin expression both at mRNA and protein levels.</p><p xml:id="_9kgpHU2">Resistin Is Retained in ER upon ER Stress. Having observed that hRes, a secretory protein, is induced during ER stress, we next asked if the secretion of hRes is affected during ER stress. U937 cells were treated with either tn or tp (5 μg/mL), and secretory hRes levels in the supernatant, collected at 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment, were analyzed by ELISA (Adipo Gen). hRes is overexpressed during tunicamycin and thapsigargin induced ER stress; ELISA data showed secretion impairment resulting in an about 40-50% decline in resistin secretion <ref type="figure" coords="3,463.18,584.48,62.02,8.72" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5 A and B)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_7z3y6RX">To address this issue of differential secretion, we examined the localization of hRes during ER stress by confocal microscopy. Immunocytochemistry was performed on untreated and 5 μg/mL tn-or tp-treated U937 cells for 24 h using antibodies specific to hRes or calreticulin, an ER resident protein. It can be seen that hRes colocalized with calreticulin <ref type="figure" coords="3,439.37,642.70,98.80,8.31" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5C, merged panel)</ref>. Furthermore, the increase in expression of hRes after 24 h of treatment in terms of increased Cy3 intensity is also evident. It is therefore apparent that, under conditions of ER stress, although resistin continues overall to be induced, the bulk of it remains within ER. These results demonstrate that tn/tp-induced stress caused a reduction in the levels of secretory resistin despite increased expression levels and that the bulk of the intracellular hRes was localized to the ER. HeLa cells (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells) were used for studying the impact of transiently expressed hRes in rescuing cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were transfected with either empty vector pCDNA or pCDNAhRes carrying hRes gene (schematically represented in <ref type="figure" coords="4,150.12,280.27,22.93,8.31">Fig. S7</ref>), and expression of resistin was confirmed by RT-PCR <ref type="figure" coords="4,134.27,289.73,32.06,8.31">(Fig. S8)</ref>.

Apoptosis was induced in these cells using 15 μg of tp for 24 h, and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was scored using Annexin V staining per the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen).

In line with its role as a possible chaperone under stress conditions, this secretory protein was retained in ER during stress, suggesting a possible link between inflammation and cellular stress. Discussion hRes, a small cysteine-rich secretory protein produced in macrophages, although initially proposed to be a link between diabetes and insulin resistance, is emerging as an important player in inflammation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,363.63,301.01,10.09,8.31" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,375.87,301.01,6.72,8.31" target="#b4">5)</ref>.

Extending our earlier studies, we now report that hRes has chaperone-like activity that can protect proteins from denaturation and retain their activity.</p><p xml:id="_YNQnJQF">The molecular model of hRes, constructed using a mouse 3D model as a template, shows an interesting funnel-shaped structure, with an orifice at one end, for probable interaction with the unfolded proteins. Based on this homology model, four sites on hRes, namely Leu42, Pro46, Phe49, and Trp80, were found to be exposed on the surface. These residues may play a role in imparting surface hydrophobicity to the molecule. Surface hydrophobicity is critical for chaperones as these are considered instrumental in interactions with unfolded or misfolded proteins <ref type="bibr" coords="4,301.38,434.35,14.35,8.31" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and replacement of any of these hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic residues should result in significant structural alterations, which would then disrupt interaction with misfolded proteins, as reported for some heat-shock proteins <ref type="bibr" coords="4,510.68,462.98,14.99,8.31" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. We observed that the same replacement of Phe-49 by Tyr drastically reduced the ability of hRes to interact with misfolded proteins, implicating its importance in wild-type rhRes.

Comparison of mutant F49YhRes with wild-type hRes, in terms of chaperone activity, gave results consistent with these predictions. Furthermore, ANS-binding analysis of F49YrhRes showed a decrease in absorbance compared with rhRes, a reflection of the loss of surface hydrophobicity due to F49Y mutation.</p><p xml:id="_YYVWqdJ">The computational simulation data served as the basis for experiments to demonstrate chaperone-like function of the hRes protein by using heat-and the alkali-labile enzyme CS and the restriction enzyme Nde1. Unlike CS and Nde1, rhRes was refractile to heat-induced aggregation, pointing to its thermal stability. However, when both heat-labile CS and Nde1 proteins were individually incubated at 45°C for 45 min in the presence of rhRes not only could aggregation be prevented, but also almost 80% of activities could be restored. The mutant F49YrhRes could not assist in restoring enzyme activities, although it could provide protection from thermal aggregations. It is likely that structural alteration and the declined molecular reassociation due to F49Y change, although rendering the mutant protein refractile to thermal aggregation, caused subtle change(s) in structure that prevented the ability of F49YrhRes to act as a chaperone. F49YrhRes was able to make a complex with denatured CS, similar to wild-type rhRes, when assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. E. coli M15 cells were transformed with plasmid pQE30, pQE30hRes, or pQE30F49YhRes. Note that after heat treatment for 45 min at 50°C, E. coli M15 cells transformed with hRes showed a more than sevenfold survival compared with pQE30 vector control, whereas those transformed with mutant F49YhRes showed significantly reduced survival compared with wild-type hRes.

ATP was not required for preventing the aggregation of CS due to high temperature, suggesting that hRes is an ATP-independent chaperone. Similar examples of proteins that work like a chaperone under cellular stress conditions in the absence of ATP hydrolysis have been reported; these include Clusterin <ref type="bibr" coords="5,178.45,471.72,14.98,8.31" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, which is a secretory mammalian chaperone, and Spy <ref type="formula" coords="5,172.24,481.30,14.99,8.31">(23)</ref>, an E. coli periplasmic protein that showed chaperone-like activity in vitro.

The adaptive response involves the induction of both constitutively expressed or induced conserved heat-shock proteins and chaperones.

With in vitro evidence of hRes as a probable chaperone, we further tested its role during induced ER stress by checking the expression levels and localization of hRes during tn-and tp-induced ER stress in U937 cells. Levels of hRes protein were observed to be substantially elevated under both these treatments. It therefore appears that, like many other chaperones, hRes was also overexpressed during ER stress. Interestingly, hRes also colocalized with calreticulin in a time-dependent manner, indicating that it remained in the ER during stress induced by tn and tp treatment. This is in agreement with literature reports that chaperones are restricted to the ER upon stress to assist in the refolding of misfolded proteins <ref type="bibr" coords="5,419.18,119.54,14.35,8.31" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_mF33yN8">The logical question, then, is that, if hRes is secreted out, how can it possibly function as a chaperone inside the cell? We therefore looked at the levels of secreted hRes under normal and stress conditions. Levels of secreted hRes during ER stress were significantly less compared with nonstress conditions. However, intracellular levels of hRes under conditions of ER stress were significantly higher. This supports the scenario that, upon ER stress, a significant fraction of hRes was retained inside the cell, within the ER, to aid in protein folding. As a corollary, under non-ER stress conditions, the secretory hRes then functions as a proinflammatory molecule.</p><p xml:id="_8CeFDp4">In two prospective studies of patients with sepsis (28), resistin was observed to be a marker of severity of disease and was a possible mediator of prolonged inflammatory state seen in critically ill patients. hRes was suggested as a biomarker for disease staging and treatment end-point determination in tuberculosis <ref type="bibr" coords="5,339.48,281.68,14.35,8.31" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.
